## Compiling
### Windows
First, install **[spasm](https://github.com/alberthdev/spasm-ng/releases)**.
Then, move the executable into the root folder of GeometryDashCE and execute `spasm64.exe -E src/GD.z80 bin/AGD.8xp`.

### Linux
First, install **[spasm](https://github.com/alberthdev/spasm-ng/releases)**.
Open a terminal and type :
- `make build` to compile GeometryDashCE and generate [AGD.8xp](bin/AGD.8xp).
- `make send` to send bin/AGD.8xp to the calculator (requires [tilp](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tilp/)).
- `make build_send` as a shortcut of `make build ; make send`.
- `make sendall` to send all necessary files to run GD (without compiling).
- `make archive` to build a portable archive of GeometryDashCE.

## How can I create my own level on my computer ?
- Download and install Tiled, a software that will allow you to create a level from a specific tileset.
- In Tiled, create a level with a height of at least 10 tiles, then import the [tileset](images/GD.png) (Map -> New Tileset).
- When you're satisfied of your level, export it with the .CSV extension.
- Then, go to http://geometrydash.fr.nf and copy/paste the content of the .CSV file in the "data" field. Give it a name, a speed and a difficulty. 
- If your level has a spaceship or a reversed gravity context, put them in the provided fields : each time you want to insert a new context, just put the tile numbers of the context changes separated by commas (ex : "12,45,48,127" = [12,45[U[48,127[)
- Once you download the Appvar, upload it into you calculator and.. you're done!

> **Warning**
>
> Make sure you :
> - do not end your level with a reversed gravity context
> - are not in a reversed gravity and spaceship context at the same time
> - do not put a changing of context just before the end of the level

> **Note** :
